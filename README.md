# fCC Challenges: Information Security with HelmetJS  

1. **Install and require Helmet**. [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. Install the package, then require it.  
2. **Hide Potentially Dangerous Information Using `helmet.hidePoweredBy()`**.  Hackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node if they see that your site is powered by Express. `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every request coming from Express by default. The `hidePoweredBy` middleware will remove the `X-Powered-By` header. You can also explicitly set the header to something else, to throw people off. e.g. `helmet.hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' })`.  
3. **Mitigate the Risk of Clickjacking with `helmet.frameguard()`**. Your page could be put in a `<frame>` or `<iframe>` without your consent. This can result in [clickjacking attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking), among other things. Clickjacking is a technique of tricking a user into interacting with a page different from what the user thinks it is. Often this happens using another page put over the framed original, in a transparent layer. The `X-Frame-Options` header set by this middleware restricts who can put your site in a frame. It has three modes: DENY, SAMEORIGIN, and ALLOW-FROM. We don't need our app to be framed, so you should use `helmet.frameguard()` passing to it the configuration object `{action: 'deny'}`.
